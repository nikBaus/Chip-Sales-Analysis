# Chip-Sales-Analysis
This project is to understand the types of customers who purchase chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

Impact: To provide insights which will feed the strategic plan for chips sales in the next half year

Task: To present a strategic recommendation that is supported by data which can then be used for the upcoming category review. To do so, the data must be analyzed to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours particularly in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. 

Execution: The data was imported into R after all relevant libraries have been loaded. Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to under the data i.e., the data types, the completeness, the consistency among others. During exploration, the date column was discovered to be in the wrong format/type and it was changed. All symbols, mispositioned digits, and outliers were removed making the data ready for analysis.
Various chart types were used to visualize different findings to understand the purchasing behaviour of chips of customers based on their class and life stage, the chips pack size, brand of chips. These variables helped to set metrics buy which the purchasing behaviour of the customers was measured.

Insights: Mainstream midage and young singles and couples are ore willing to pay more per packet of chips compared to their budget and premium counterparts. For a deeper analysis, the mainstream young singles/couples were used as the target customer segment to check the likelihood of purchasing different brands and sizes of chips than other customer segments. It was later discovered that the target segment was 24% more likely to purchase the Tyrells brand chips than other segments while they are 56% less likely to purchase Burger Rings than the rest. Also, they are 27% likelier to purchase 270g pack of chips than the rest of the customers.
Recommendations: More Tyrells and smaller packs of chips should be moved to where young singles and couples will notice them more for more sales

Experimentation and Uplift testing
3 stores have been chosen as trial stores and control stores, which have similar sales profile, are to be found out.
Metrics for the period pre-trial were set and tests were carried out to check the performance of stores as against the trial store.
